# ThinkingModels Development Plan

## Project Overview
A Python project that empowers LLMs with different thinking models for solving real-life problems through a two-phase query handling system.

## Development Steps

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] **Step 1: Model Files Parsing**
  - [x] Create models directory structure
  - [x] Define thinking model file format (XML-like text)
  - [x] Implement model parser to load and index models by ID
  - [x] Create data structure to store models in memory
  - [x] Add validation for model file format

- [x] **Step 2: LLM API Integration**
  - [x] Create OpenAI-compatible API client
  - [x] Support environment variable configuration for API URL
  - [x] Implement error handling and retry logic
  - [x] Add support for different model configurations
  - [x] Refine system prompts for model selection (0-3 models)
  - [x] Include model definitions in selection prompts
  - [x] Add context window monitoring and word counting

- [x] **Step 3: Query Processing Engine**
  - [x] Implement Phase 1: Model selection prompt template
  - [x] Implement Phase 2: Problem-solving prompt template
  - [x] Create query processor to orchestrate the two phases
  - [x] Add response parsing and validation

### Phase 2: User Interfaces
- [x] **Step 4: CLI Interface**
  - [x] Create command-line interface using argparse/click
  - [x] Support interactive and batch query modes
  - [x] Add configuration options for API settings
  - [x] Implement result formatting and display

- [x] **Step 5: Web Server & UI**
  - [x] Set up FastAPI web server with comprehensive REST API
  - [x] Create REST API endpoints for query handling and model management
  - [x] Design and implement responsive web UI (HTML/CSS/JS)
  - [x] Add real-time query processing via WebSockets
  - [x] Implement model browsing, filtering, and search functionality
  - [x] Add result export and sharing capabilities

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Testing
- [ ] **Step 6: Testing & Validation**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for all components
  - [ ] Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
  - [ ] Performance testing with different model sets
  - [ ] Error handling and edge case testing

- [x] **Step 7: Documentation & Deployment**
  - [x] Write comprehensive README with usage examples
  - [x] Add detailed API documentation with REST and WebSocket specs
  - [x] Create deployment guide with Docker and cloud options
  - [x] Add CLI documentation with detailed usage instructions
  - [x] Provide Docker configuration and deployment scripts
  - [x] Include license and comprehensive project documentation
