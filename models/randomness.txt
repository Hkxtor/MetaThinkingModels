<define>
Randomness describes events or processes that lack a predictable pattern or deterministic cause. In math and science, randomness isn't "arbitrary"â€”it follows probabilistic rules but resists precise forecasting for individual outcomes.

<example>
Problem: Does a new drug work?
Randomness Insight: Randomly assign patients to control/treatment groups to eliminate bias.
Decision Impact: Ensures results reflect true efficacy, not confounding variables.

Counterintuitive Aspects of Randomness
Gamble's Fallacy: Mistaking independence for "balancing" (e.g., "Red is due!" in roulette).
Clustering Illusion: Seeing patterns in random data (e.g., "hot streaks" in sports).
Benford's Law: Non-uniform digit distributions in real-world data (e.g., tax fraud detection).

Tools to Harness Randomness
Random Sampling: Polls, clinical trials.
Monte Carlo Simulations: Modeling complex risks (e.g., retirement planning).
A/B Testing: Randomly exposing users to website variants.
