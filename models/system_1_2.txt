From Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow
System 1 (Fast Thinking):
Automatic, intuitive, and effortless (e.g., recognizing faces, understanding sarcasm).
Pros: Quick, energy-efficient.
Cons: Prone to biases (e.g., stereotypes, snap judgments).
System 2 (Slow Thinking):
Effortful, logical, and deliberate (e.g., solving math problems, choosing a mortgage).
Pros: Accurate, analytical.
Cons: Slow, mentally taxing.

<example>
Medicine: Diagnosing Patients
System 1 (When to use):
A doctor spots classic symptoms of the flu (fever, fatigue) and makes a quick diagnosis.
System 2 (When to switch):
If symptoms are ambiguous (e.g., chest pain could be indigestion or a heart attack), slow down and run tests.
Key Insight: Experts use System 1 for pattern recognition but know when to engage System 2 for complex cases.
</example>

<example>
Investing: Financial Decisions
System 1 (Pitfall):
Buying a trending stock because it "feels right" (recency bias).
System 2 (Solution):
Analyzing the company's fundamentals (P/E ratio, cash flow) before investing.
Pro Tip: Automate good habits (e.g., dollar-cost averaging) to avoid emotional System 1 traps.

<example>
Marketing: Designing Ads
System 1 (Hook):
Using bold colors, celebrity endorsements, or fear appeals ("Last chance!") to trigger quick emotional responses.
System 2 (Justify):
Adding data ("Clinically proven") for skeptical customers who deliberate.
Rule: Appeal to System 1 first, then back it up with System 2 logic.
