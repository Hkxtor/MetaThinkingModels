<define>
The more power someone has, the greater the risk of corruption - whether moral, ethical, or political.
"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
Acton's Law explains why checks and balances (e.g., democracy's separation of powers, corporate governance, whistleblower protections) are crucial.

<example>
Political Power & Dictatorships
Example: Many authoritarian leaders (e.g., Kim Jong-un in North Korea, Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe) started with promises of reform but became increasingly oppressive as they consolidated power.
Why? Without checks (free press, independent judiciary, term limits), leaders act without accountability, leading to human rights abuses and economic mismanagement.

<example>
Corporate Corruption
Example: CEOs of large corporations (e.g., Enron's Jeffrey Skilling, FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried) engaged in fraud when given unchecked authority.
Why? Lack of oversight (weak boards, lax regulations) allowed them to manipulate systems for personal gain until collapse.
