A power law describes a relationship where a small number of items account for the majority of effects, while a long tail of many items contributes minimally.
Key feature: A "winner-takes-most" dynamic, unlike the symmetric bell curve. 
Can be observed in Wealth Distribution, City Populations, Earthquake Magnitudes, Book Sales, Social Media, etc.

<example>
Field: Business (Pareto Principle – 80/20 Rule)
Use Case: 80% of revenue often comes from 20% of customers.
Example: Amazon focuses on high-volume "head" products (e.g., iPhones) while still stocking the "long tail" (niche books).
Decision Impact: Prioritize key clients or products for growth.
</example>

<example>
Field: Investing (Venture Capital)
Use Case: Most startups fail, but a few (e.g., Facebook, Tesla) deliver 1000x returns.
Example: Y Combinator invests in 100+ startups knowing 1–2 will cover all losses.
Decision Impact: Diversify bets and embrace asymmetric returns.
</example>

<example>
Field: Technology (Network Effects)
Use Case: Platforms like Facebook or Airbnb grow exponentially because value scales with users.
Example: The first 1M users are hard to acquire; the next 100M come easily.
Decision Impact: Early traction is critical—dominate a niche before scaling.
</example>

<example>
Field: Career Strategy (Skill Stacking)
Use Case: Top performers in fields like sports or tech earn orders of magnitude more.
Example: A top 1% programmer may earn 10x an average one.
Decision Impact: Specialize or combine rare skills (e.g., coding + design + storytelling).
