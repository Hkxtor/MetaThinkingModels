<define>
Dunbar's Number is the cognitive limit to the number of stable social relationships a person can maintainâ€”approximately 150. It reflects the brain's capacity to track social nuances (trust, history, obligations). Beyond this, relationships become superficial.

<example>
Social Media ("Friends" vs. Real Connections)
Observation: You might have 1,000 Facebook "friends," but only ~150 ever interact meaningfully.
Practical Use: Curate your inner circle - focus energy on relationships that reciprocate. Ignore FOMO; humans aren't wired to maintain 500 close ties.
</example>

<example>
Military (Unit Design)
Example: Roman armies and modern militaries organize squads of ~150 soldiers for trust/coordination.
Practical Use: Structure groups where everyone knows each other's roles/strengths.
