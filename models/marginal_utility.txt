Marginal Utility (MU) is the additional satisfaction or benefit a person gains from consuming one more unit of a good or service. It is a key concept in economics that helps explain how individuals make decisions based on diminishing returns, the idea that each additional unit consumed provides less utility than the previous one.

<example>
Time Management (Productivity)
Studying for an examâ€”the first hour is highly productive (high MU), the second hour still helps, but after several hours, fatigue sets in, and retention drops (low MU).
Behavioral Insight: Instead of cramming for 8 hours straight, it's better to take breaks or switch subjects when MU declines, maximizing overall learning efficiency.

Business & Resource Allocation
A company hires additional workers. The first few employees significantly boost production (high MU), but after a point, adding more workers leads to overcrowding and inefficiency (low or negative MU, known as diminishing returns).
Behavioral Insight: Businesses should stop hiring when the marginal benefit of a new worker equals the cost (wage), optimizing labor use.
