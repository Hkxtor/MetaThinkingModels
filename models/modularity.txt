<define>
Modularity is the design principle of breaking a complex system into smaller, self-contained units (modules) that can be developed, replaced, or upgraded independently while maintaining seamless integration with the whole.

<example>
Technology & Software
Example: Microservices Architecture
Instead of monolithic apps (where all code is interdependent), systems are split into modular services (e.g., user authentication, payment processing).
Why? If the payment module fails, the rest of the app keeps running.
Real-world: Netflix uses microservices to stream videos reliably to 200M+ users.

Urban Planning & Infrastructure
Example: Prefabricated Housing
Buildings are assembled from factory-made modules (walls, floors).
Why? Faster construction, lower cost, and easier repairs.
Real-world: Singapore uses modular housing to address land scarcity.
