A state machine (or finite-state machine, FSM) is a computational model that describes a system as:
A set of states (conditions the system can be in)
A set of transitions (how the system moves between states)
A set of inputs/events that trigger transitions
</define>

<example>
Electronics & Hardware Design
Vending Machines
States: Idle, Payment Received, Dispensing Item
Transitions: Money inserted → move to "Payment Received"
</example>

<example>
Biology & Neuroscience
Neuron Firing States
States: Resting, Depolarizing, Firing, Refractory
Transitions: Electrical threshold reached → Firing
</example>

<example>
Healthcare & Medical Devices
Pacemaker Operation
States: Monitoring, Pacing, Charging
Transitions: Irregular heartbeat detected → deliver shock.
</example>
