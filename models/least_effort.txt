<define>
This principle states that individuals, animals, and even systems tend to choose the path of minimal energy expenditure to achieve a goal. It's a universal behavior pattern observed in biology, economics, technology, and social systems.

<example>
Human Behavior (Psychology & UX Design)
Example: People scroll endlessly on social media instead of searching for specific content because scrolling requires less cognitive effort.
Why? The brain defaults to passive consumption over active effort.
Impact: Apps like TikTok and Instagram optimize for infinite scroll to exploit this tendency.

<example>
Biology (Animal Foraging & Evolution)
Example: Lions hunt weaker prey (e.g., young or injured animals) rather than healthy adults to minimize energy spent per calorie gained.
Why? Natural selection favors energy-efficient survival strategies.
Impact: Ecosystems balance around predators optimizing effort vs. reward.
