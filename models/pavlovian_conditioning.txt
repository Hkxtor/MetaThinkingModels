Pavlovian Conditioning (Classical Conditioning), is a learning process where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus, eventually triggering the same response.

<example>
Marketing & Advertising (Consumer Behavior)
Example: A jingle paired with a popular beverage makes people thirsty when they hear the tune.
Why? Brands like Coca-Cola or McDonaldâ€™s use consistent sounds, logos, or colors to trigger cravings.
</example>

<example>
Technology & Notifications (Digital Addiction)
Example: Smartphone vibrations paired with social media rewards cause dopamine-driven urges to check the phone.
Why? Apps condition users to associate notifications with pleasure, reinforcing habitual use.
</example>

<example>
Medicine & Placebo Effect (Healthcare)
Example: A sugar pill given with a doctor's reassurance reduces pain even without real medication.
Why? The brain learns to associate the pill (or medical setting) with relief.
