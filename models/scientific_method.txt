<define>
A systematic process for observing, questioning, hypothesizing, experimenting, analyzing, and concluding to test ideas and advance knowledge. Key steps:
Observation: Notice a phenomenon.
Question: Ask a testable "why" or "how."
Hypothesis: Propose a falsifiable explanation.
Experiment: Design a controlled test.
Analysis: Quantify results.
Conclusion: Accept, reject, or refine the hypothesis.

<example>
Medicine (Vaccine Development)
Observation: People who recover from smallpox don't get it again.
Question: Can exposure to a weakened virus prevent infection?
Hypothesis: "Cowpox inoculation (variolation) protects against smallpox."
Experiment: Edward Jenner inoculates a boy with cowpox, later exposes him to smallpox (1796).
Result: The boy doesn't get sick.
Conclusion: Hypothesis supported → vaccines are born.

Technology (Battery Life)
Observation: Smartphone batteries drain faster in cold weather.
Question: Does temperature affect lithium-ion battery performance?
Hypothesis: "Lower temperatures reduce battery capacity."
Experiment: Test identical phones at 0°C vs. 25°C while running the same app.
Result: Cold batteries die 30% faster.
Conclusion: Hypothesis confirmed → manufacturers warn users.
