The Hype Cycle is a model developed by Gartner to track the maturity, adoption, and societal impact of emerging technologies.
The 5 Key Phases:
Innovation Trigger – A breakthrough sparks media and investor excitement.
Peak of Inflated Expectations – Hype exceeds reality; early adopters jump in, but many fail.
Trough of Disillusionment – Interest fades as early implementations disappoint.
Slope of Enlightenment – Practical uses emerge; businesses refine the technology.
Plateau of Productivity – Mainstream adoption; technology delivers consistent value.

<example>
Technology & Business Strategy
Use Case: Deciding when to invest in AI.
Peak (2016–2018): Overpromises of "general AI" led to inflated startups.
Trough (2019–2020): Many AI firms folded; skepticism grew.
Slope (2021–2025): Narrow AI (e.g., GPT, Midjourney) proves useful.
Lesson: Companies that waited past the peak avoided costly mistakes.

<example>
Healthcare (Medical Innovations)
Use Case: CRISPR gene editing.
Peak (2015–2016): "Designer babies" hype.
Trough (2017–2019): Ethical scandals (e.g., He Jiankui case).
Slope (2020–2025): FDA-approved therapies (e.g., sickle-cell treatment).
Lesson: Pharma companies now focus on incremental, ethical applications.

Automotive (Self-Driving Cars)
Use Case: Autonomous vehicles (AVs).
Peak (2016–2018): "Robotaxis by 2020!" (Tesla, Uber).
Trough (2019–2022): Fatal crashes; Waymo scales back.
Slope (2023–2025): Limited AV zones (e.g., Cruise in SF).
Lesson: Incremental automation (e.g., Tesla Autopilot) wins over full autonomy.
