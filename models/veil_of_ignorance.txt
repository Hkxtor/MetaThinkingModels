The veil of ignorance is a thought experiment where decision-makers design societal rules without knowing their own future status (e.g., wealth, race, gender). This ensures impartiality, as no one can rig the system in their favor.
Key Idea: "What rules would you choose if you didn't know who you'd become?"

<example>
Designing Fair Laws (Politics/Policy)
Example: Creating a tax system.
Behind the Veil: You don't know if you'll be rich or poor.
Fair Outcome: Progressive taxation (wealthier pay more), as everyone would want a safety net if they ended up disadvantaged.
</example>

<example>
Education Reform
Example: Allocating school resources.
Behind the Veil: You don't know if you'll be born into a wealthy or underfunded district.
Fair Outcome: Equitable funding across schools, as everyone would want quality education regardless of zip code.

<example>
Climate Justice (Global Ethics)
Example: Deciding carbon emission limits.
Behind the Veil: You don't know if you'll live in a flood-prone island nation or an oil-rich superpower.
Fair Outcome: Strict global emissions standards, as those most vulnerable to climate change would demand protection.
