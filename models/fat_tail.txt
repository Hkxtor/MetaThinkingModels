<define>
A fat tail distribution describes a probability pattern where extreme events (outliers) occur more frequently than predicted by a normal (Gaussian) distribution. 
Unlike the rapid decay of the bell curve's tails, fat tails imply higher odds of rare but catastrophic or lucrative outcomes.

<example>
Field: Technology (Viral Content)
Example: Most tweets flop, but a few (e.g., celebrity scandals) get 100M+ views.
Decision Impact: Platforms optimize for virality, not averages.
</example>

<example>
Field: Finance (Market Crashes)
Example: The 2008 crisis was a 5σ "impossible" event under Gaussian models—but predictable with fat tails.
Decision Impact: Use tail-risk hedging (e.g., gold, puts).
Avoid over-reliance on "normal" risk models (VaR fails here).
