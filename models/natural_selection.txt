<define>
Natural selection is the process by which traits that improve survival and reproduction become more common in a population over generations, while disadvantageous traits fade out. Proposed by Charles Darwin, it's the engine of evolution.

<example>
Medicine (Antibiotic Resistance)
How It Works: Overusing antibiotics kills weak bacteria, leaving resistant mutants to multiply.
Actionable Insight: Use antibiotics sparingly to slow resistance. Develop rotating drug protocols to outpace evolution.
</example>

<example>
Technology (Algorithmic Evolution)
How It Works: AI models (e.g., GPT) improve through "survival of the fittest" training cycles.
Actionable Insight: Test multiple versions, keep what works, discard what doesn't.
