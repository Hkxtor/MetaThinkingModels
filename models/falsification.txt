<define>
The key principle of falsification: "For a claim to be scientific, there must be a way to prove it wrong."
</define>

<example>
Hypothesis: "All swans are white."
Falsification Test: Search for a non-white swan (e.g., finding a black swan in Australia disproves the hypothesis).
Outcome: The hypothesis is falsifiable and thus scientific.
</example>

<example>
Claim: "Eating fat makes you gain weight."
Falsification Test: Observe populations on high-fat, low-carb diets (e.g., ketogenic diets).
Outcome: If weight loss occurs, the claim is partially falsified (calories matter more than fat alone).
</example>

<example>
Assumption: "Our product is successful because of its low price."
Falsification Test: Raise the price—if sales stay strong, price isn’t the key driver.
Outcome: Reveals other factors (e.g., brand loyalty, quality).
