Emergence describes how complex systems exhibit properties or behaviors that arise from the interactions of their individual componentsâ€”properties that aren't predictable from the parts alone.
Key Idea: "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."

<example>
Economics (Market Trends)
Emergent Property: No single investor controls the stock market, but collective actions create bubbles, crashes, and trends.
Decision Impact: Watch for emergent patterns (e.g., meme stock frenzies) rather than relying solely on fundamentals.
</example>

<example>
Neuroscience (Consciousness)
Emergent Mystery: Neurons fire electrically, but their collective activity generates subjective experience.
Decision Impact: AI ethics - If consciousness emerges in machines, how do we treat them?
</example>

<example>
Biology (Ant Colonies)
Emergent Behavior: Individual ants follow simple rules (e.g., follow pheromone trails), but the colony builds intricate nests, farms fungi, and wages wars.
Decision Impact: Swarm robotics: Design drones that collaborate like ants for search-and-rescue.
