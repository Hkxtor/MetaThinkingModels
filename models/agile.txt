Agile is an iterative, flexible approach to project management and product development that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and incremental progress.
Key Agile Principles:
Iterative Progress – Work is done in small cycles (sprints/iterations).
Adaptability – Responding to change over following a fixed plan.
Continuous Improvement – Regular retrospectives to refine processes.

<example>
Software Development (Original Use Case)
Example: A team at Spotify uses Agile (specifically Scrum & Kanban) to release frequent updates.
Work is split into 2-week sprints.
Daily stand-up meetings track progress.
Features are tested early with users, reducing wasted effort.
</example>

<example>
Manufacturing (Lean-Agile Hybrid)
Example: Tesla's production line applies Agile principles.
Rapid prototyping of car components.
Continuous feedback from engineers and drivers.
Adjustments made in real-time (e.g., over-the-air software updates).
</example>

<example>
Finance (Agile Budgeting & Startups)
Example: Fintech startups like Revolut use Agile for product launches.
Instead of a 5-year plan, they release minimum viable products (MVPs).
User feedback drives new features (e.g., cryptocurrency trading).
Risk is minimized by testing ideas in small markets first.
