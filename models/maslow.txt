<define>
This theory organizes human motivations into a five-tier pyramid, where lower-level needs must be satisfied before higher ones become priorities. The tiers are:
Physiological Needs (food, water, shelter)
Safety Needs (security, stability, health)
Love/Belonging (relationships, community)
Esteem (respect, achievement, confidence)
Self-Actualization (fulfilling potential, creativity, purpose)
</define>

<example>
Workplace Motivation (Business/HR)
Physiological: Fair wages allow employees to afford basics like food and rent.
Safety: Job security and health insurance reduce anxiety.
Belonging: Team-building activities foster camaraderie.
Esteem: Promotions and public recognition boost confidence.
Self-Actualization: Creative projects or leadership roles align with personal growth.
Why It Matters: Companies like Google prioritize employee well-being (free meals, flexible work) to unlock higher productivity and innovation.

<example>
Education (Student Development)
Physiological: School lunch programs ensure kids aren't hungry in class.
Safety: Anti-bullying policies create a secure learning environment.
Belonging: Group projects and clubs help students form friendships.
Esteem: Awards or teacher praise motivate academic effort.
Self-Actualization: Advanced courses or arts programs nurture passions.
Why It Matters: Struggling students often can't focus on learning until basic needs are met (e.g., homeless students).
