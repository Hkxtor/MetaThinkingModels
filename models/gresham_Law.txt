<define>
Gresham's Law states that "bad money drives out good" when two forms of currency circulate simultaneously: people hoard the more valuable money and spend the less valuable one, pushing the "good" money out of circulation.

<example>
Digital Media (Misinformation)
Example: On social media, sensationalist "bad" content (fake news, clickbait) spreads faster than nuanced "good" content because it's more engaging.
Decision Impact: Platforms must algorithmically reward accuracy (e.g., Twitter's community notes) to prevent misinformation from dominating.

<example>
Environmental Policy (Carbon Credits)
Example: If "weak" carbon credits (easily gamed) are treated equally with "strong" ones, companies will buy the weak ones, undermining emissions goals.
Decision Impact: Regulators must standardize credit quality to avoid a "race to the bottom."
