Compounding is the process where a quantity grows at an accelerating rate because its growth is repeatedly multiplied by itself over time, rather than added linearly.

<example>
Field: Finance (Wealth Building)
Mechanism: Reinvesting interest/dividends generates earnings on prior earnings.
Example: Invest $10,000 at 7% annual return. After 30 years: $73,000.
Decision Impact: Start investing early—time magnifies small differences.
</example>

<example>
Field: Technology (Moore's Law)
Mechanism: Computing power doubles every ~2 years (exponential growth in transistors/chip).
Example: A $1,000 laptop today outperforms a 1980s supercomputer.
Decision Impact: Industries bet on continued exponential progress (e.g., AI, quantum computing).
</example>

<example>
Field: Health
Mechanism: Small daily habits compound into drastic long-term results.
Example:
Good: Walking 30 mins/day → 10% lower heart disease risk/year → 92% lower risk over 30 years (simplified model).
Bad: Smoking 1 cigarette/day → 50% higher lung cancer risk over 20 years.
