The network effect occurs when a product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it. It creates a positive feedback loop: users attract more users, leading to exponential growth and often market dominance.
</define>

<example>
Field: Social Media (Facebook, Instagram)
How It Works: More users - more content and connections - more reasons for others to join.
Decision Impact: Early adoption is key (e.g., brands that joined Instagram early gained free reach).
Exit barriers rise as networks grow (hard to leave WhatsApp when everyone uses it).
</example>

<example>
Field: Language (English as Global Lingua Franca)
How It Works: More speakers - more materials (books, films) - more learners.
Decision Impact: Learning English has higher ROI than niche languages due to network size.
</example>

<example>
Field: Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin)
How It Works: More users - more liquidity/acceptance - higher perceived value.
Decision Impact: Early miners earned disproportional rewards as the network grew.
