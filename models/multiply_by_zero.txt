<define>
This concept, inspired by the mathematical idea that any number multiplied by zero equals zero, refers to the idea that a single critical weakness can negate all other strengths in a system. It's also called the "Shortest Plank Theory" (from the proverb "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link").

<example>
Field: Engineering & Safety (Structural Integrity)
Example: A bridge with 99% robust materials but one corroded bolt can collapse.
Decision Impact: Prioritize redundancy and regular inspections.
Fix critical vulnerabilities first (e.g., aircraft maintenance).
</example>

<example>
Field: Cybersecurity (Network Defense)
Example: A company with firewalls, encryption, but one employee clicking a phishing link - data breach.
Decision Impact: Train all staff, not just upgrade tech.
</example>

<example>
Field: Business (Product Launches)
Example: A smartphone with cutting-edge specs but a fatal software bug (e.g., Samsung Galaxy Note 7's battery fires).
Decision Impact: Stress-test all components before release. A single PR disaster can erase years of brand equity.
