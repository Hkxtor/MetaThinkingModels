<define>
A stochastic process is a collection of random variables representing how a system evolves over time or space in a probabilistic (non-deterministic) way. Unlike fixed equations, it models uncertainty and randomness in dynamic systems. It's a mathematical 'movie' where each frame is a probability distribution.

<example>
Field: Medicine (Disease Spread)
Process: SIR Model (Stochastic Infectious Disease model).
Use Case: Simulates COVID-19 spread with random interactions. Guides lockdowns/vaccine distribution. Estimating herd immunity thresholds.
</example>

<example>
Field: Engineering (Reliability Analysis)
Process: Poisson Process (random failures over time).
Use Case: Predicts when a machine part might fail. Optimizes maintenance schedules.
Example: Airline engine checks to prevent mid-flight failures.

<example>
Field: Operations (Queue Management)
Process: Queuing Theory (e.g., M/M/1 queues).
Use Case: Models call center wait times with random arrivals. Optimizes staffing to reduce customer frustration.
Example: How many cashiers to open at a supermarket.
