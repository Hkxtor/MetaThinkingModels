<define>
Critical mass refers to the point at which a system, process, or phenomenon reaches a threshold sufficient to trigger a significant change, sustain itself, or produce a desired outcome. 
It's the minimum amount of something—people, resources, momentum—needed for a self-reinforcing effect to take hold.

Technology Adoption
Scenario: The rise of social media platforms like Facebook.
Explanation: Early on, Facebook needed enough users to make it valuable—people join networks where their friends already are (the network effect). Once it hit a critical mass of users, its growth exploded as more joined to connect with the existing base.
How It Applies: Critical mass here is the user threshold where the platform becomes self-sustaining, explaining why some tech products take off while others languish without enough early adopters.

Physics and Energy
Scenario: Nuclear chain reaction in a fission bomb.
Explanation: A nuclear explosion requires a critical mass of fissile material (e.g., uranium-235). Below this amount, neutrons escape without sustaining fission; once critical mass is reached, each splitting atom triggers others, releasing massive energy.
How It Applies: This literal origin of the term shows how a precise threshold transforms a dormant system into an unstoppable reaction, foundational to nuclear technology.
