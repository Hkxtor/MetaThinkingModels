<define>
Chaos dynamics (or chaos theory) studies systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditionsâ€”where tiny changes can lead to vastly different outcomes. 
These systems appear random but follow deterministic rules, making them predictable in the short term but unpredictable in the long term.

<example>
Weather Forecasting
Chaos in Action: Tiny measurement errors in atmospheric data grow exponentially, limiting forecasts to ~10 days.
Decision Impact: Use probabilistic models (e.g., "30% chance of rain") rather than absolute predictions.

<example>
Traffic Flow
Chaos in Action: A single car braking can cause a miles-long traffic jam (phantom traffic waves).
Decision Impact: Autonomous cars can smooth flow by reducing human reaction delays.

Economics (Market Crashes)
Chaos in Action: A minor event (e.g., a bank collapse) can trigger global financial chaos due to interconnected systems.
Decision Impact: Diversify investments to hedge against unpredictable shocks.
