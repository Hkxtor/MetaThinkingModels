<example>
Media-Driven Fear (Shark Attacks vs. Heart Disease)
How It Works: News sensationalizes shark attacks, making them feel frequent. In reality, heart disease kills 1,000x more people.
Actionable Insight: Check statistics before panicking. Limit exposure to alarmist media.

Social Judgments (Stereotypes)
How It Works: A few viral videos of rude tourists make people assume an entire nationality is impolite.
Actionable Insight: Seek counterexamples to combat generalizations.

<example>
Investment Choices (Recent Market Crashes)
How It Works: After a stock market crash, investors avoid equities because the memory is freshâ€”even though markets usually recover.
Actionable Insight: Rely on historical data, not recency bias.
