Correlation means two variables change together, but it does not imply that one causes the other.
Causation means one variable directly affects the other in a cause-and-effect relationship.
Key Difference: Just because two things happen together doesn't mean one causes the other. 
Mistaking correlation for causation can lead to flawed decisions.

<example>
Medicine & Public Health
Observation: Ice cream sales and drowning deaths both increase in summer (positive correlation).
Misinterpretation: "Eating ice cream causes drowning."
Reality: A third factor—hot weather—leads to more swimming (increasing drowning risk) and more ice cream consumption.
Why It Matters: Public safety campaigns should focus on swimming safety, not banning ice cream.

Economics & Business
Observation: Companies that spend more on advertising tend to have higher sales (positive correlation).
Misinterpretation: "Advertising always causes higher sales."
Reality: Successful companies may simply have more money to spend on ads (reverse causality). Or, a strong product drives both ad spending and sales.
Why It Matters: A startup blindly increasing ad budgets without product quality improvements may waste money.

Social Science & Education
Observation: Children who read more books tend to perform better in school (positive correlation).
Misinterpretation: "Reading more books directly causes better grades."
Reality: Children from wealthier families may have more access to books and better tutors, parental support, or schools (confounding variables).
Why It Matters: Simply distributing books without addressing other educational inequalities may not boost performance.
