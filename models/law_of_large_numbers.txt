The Law of Large Numbers is a statistical principle stating that as the number of trials or observations increases, the average of the results will converge to the expected value. In simpler terms: "With enough data, randomness evens out, and patterns become clear."

<example>
Field: Finance (Investment Returns)
Example: A stock might swing wildly daily, but over decades, its average return aligns with its fundamental value (e.g., S&P 500's ~7% annualized return).
Decision Impact: Short-term volatility is noise; long-term investors ignore it. Diversification works because LLN smooths out individual stock risks.

<example>
Field: Manufacturing (Quality Control)
Example: A factory producing light bulbs finds 5% are defective in small batches, but the rate stabilizes at 5% over millions of units.
Decision Impact: Sample testing is sufficient to predict mass production quality.
</example>

<example>
Field: Gambling (Casino Profits)
Example: A roulette wheel has a 2.7% house edge. A single bettor might win big, but with millions of spins, the casino's profit approaches 2.7%.
Decision Impact: Casinos don't worry about short-term losses; they know LLN guarantees long-term profits.

Field: Sports (Player Performance)
Example: A baseball hitter's batting average over 10 games is erratic, but over 162 games, it reflects true skill.
Decision Impact: Teams sign players based on multi-season stats, not hot streaks.
