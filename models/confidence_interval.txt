A confidence interval (CI) is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the true value of an unknown population parameter (e.g., mean, proportion) with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%). It quantifies uncertainty in estimates.

Medicine & Public Health
Application: Testing a new drug's effectiveness.
Example: A study finds the drug reduces blood pressure by 10–15 mmHg (95% CI: 8–17 mmHg).
Why It Matters: Clinicians use this range to assess whether the effect is statistically and clinically meaningful.

Manufacturing & Quality Control
Application: Monitoring product durability.
Example: A batch of batteries lasts 120–130 hours (99% CI).
Why It Matters: If the CI falls above the industry standard, the product meets quality goals.
