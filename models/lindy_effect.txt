<define>
The Lindy Effect is the idea that the future lifespan of non-perishable things (ideas, technologies, institutions) is proportional to their current age. The longer something has existed, the longer it's likely to survive.

<example>
Technology (Programming Languages)
Example: COBOL (60+ years old) still runs banking systems, while newer languages rise and fall.
Decision Impact: Learn foundational tech (e.g., C, SQL) before chasing hyped tools.
</example>

<example>
Investing (Blue-Chip Stocks)
Example: Companies like Procter & Gamble (185+ years) outlast startups.
Decision Impact: Allocate part of your portfolio to "Lindy" assets (e.g., index funds over meme stocks).
