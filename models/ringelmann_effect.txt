<define>
A psychological phenomenon where individuals exert less effort in a group than when working alone, leading to declining group productivity as size increases.
In groups, individual accountability decreases, causing: Free-riding (letting others do the work), diffusion of responsibility ("Someone else will handle it").
</define>

<example>
Workplace (Team Projects)
Observation: In large teams, some members contribute minimally, assuming others will compensate.
Example: A 10-person marketing team misses a deadline because 3 members barely participated.
Solution: Smaller teams, clear role division, and peer evaluations.
</example>

<example>
Academia (Group Assignments)
Observation: In student group projects, 1â€“2 members often do most of the work.
Example: A 5-person biology presentation receives a low grade due to uneven contributions.
Solution: Individual grading components + peer feedback.
</example>

<example>
Open-Source Software Development
Observation: Large projects (e.g., Linux) rely on a small core of contributors while many "passengers" submit minor fixes.
Solution: Recognition systems (e.g., GitHub "Contributor" badges) to motivate participation.
