Optimal stopping is a mathematical theory that helps determine the best time to take a particular action, such as accepting an offer or making a decision, to maximize reward or minimize cost. 
It's about finding the sweet spot where waiting longer might not yield a better outcome, and acting too soon could mean missing out on something better.
The optimal strategy, assuming you're evaluating 100 candidates, is to observe the first 37 (roughly 1/e, where e ≈ 2.718) without choosing, then pick the first candidate after that who's better than all those seen so far.

<example>
Job Hunting: Say you're looking for a job and getting offers over time. You don't want to accept the first offer immediately, but you also don't want to wait forever and risk losing good options. 
Using an optimal stopping approach, you might spend the first third of your search period (say, a month out of three) just seeing what's out there to set a baseline. 
Then, take the first offer after that beats your baseline, assuming offers don't come back around. This helps you avoid settling too early or holding out too long.

Real Estate: When buying a house, you're often under pressure to bid before properties are snatched up. Suppose you have a month to look and expect to see 10 houses. 
An optimal strategy might be to view the first 3 or 4 to establish a quality benchmark, then bid on the next one that tops them—assuming you can't revisit earlier options. 
This balances the risk of missing a gem early on with the cost of overanalyzing.
