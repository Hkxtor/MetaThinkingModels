<define>
A cognitive bias where someone who is knowledgeable about a topic struggles to imagine what it's like to not know it, leading to poor communication, teaching, or decision-making. Essentially, "once you know something, it's hard to unknow it."

<example>
Education (Teachers & Students)
Example: A math professor assumes students intuitively grasp algebraic concepts because they're "obvious" to them, skipping foundational steps.
Result: Confused students who can't follow along, while the teacher grows frustrated.
Solution: Breaking down explanations as if teaching a complete beginner.
</example>

<example>
Technology (Developers & Users)
Example: A software engineer designs an app with jargon like "API endpoints" or "SSO authentication" in error messages, assuming users understand.
Result: Average users feel lost and abandon the app.
Solution: User testing with non-experts to simplify language.
</example>

<example>
Business (Managers & Employees)
Example: A CEO discusses "optimizing KPIs for QoQ growth" without explaining terms, assuming everyone is familiar.
Result: Employees nod along but don't actâ€”because they didn't truly understand.
Solution: Using plain language and confirming comprehension.
