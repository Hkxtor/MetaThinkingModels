<define>
Flow control (backpressure) is a mechanism to regulate the flow of data or tasks in a system to prevent overload. When a downstream component (e.g., a server, worker, or processor) is overwhelmed, it signals upstream to slow down or pause incoming requests until it can catch up.

<example>
Traffic Management (Urban Planning)
Problem: Too many cars entering a highway causes gridlock.
Backpressure Solution: Ramp meters (traffic lights at on-ramps) limit how many cars enter the highway at once; Congestion pricing (e.g., tolls during peak hours) discourages overflow.
Why It Works: Prevents systemic collapse by throttling input dynamically.
</example>

<example>
Server overload (Software Engineering)
Problem: Too many client requests for the server to handle in time.
Backpressure Solution: Prevent overwhelming a system by limiting the rate of incoming requests.
</example>

<example>
Hospital Triage (Healthcare)
Problem: Emergency rooms get flooded with patients, risking care quality.
Backpressure Solution:
Triage nurses prioritize cases and redirect non-urgent patients to clinics.
Hospitals declare "diversion status" (redirecting ambulances) when overloaded.
Why It Works: Ensures critical resources (doctors, beds) go to those who need them most.
