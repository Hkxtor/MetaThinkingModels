<define>
Redundancy refers to the deliberate inclusion of backup components, systems, or information to ensure reliability if a primary element fails.
Key Idea: "Two is one, and one is none."

<example>
Field: Engineering (Aircraft Safety)
Example: Commercial jets have redundant hydraulic systems, engines, and flight controls.
Why It Matters: A single failure won't cause a crash (e.g., the 1989 Sioux City crash where redundancy allowed a powerless jet to land).
Decision Tip: In high-stakes systems, always design fail-safes.
</example>

<example>
Field: Personal Finance (Income Streams)
Example: Having a side hustle alongside a full-time job.
Why It Matters: If you lose your job, the side income buffers the blow.
Decision Tip: Follow the "25% Rule"â€”don't let any single income source exceed 25% of your total earnings.
</example>

<example>
Field: Urban Planning (Power Grids)
Example: Hospitals use backup generators when the main grid fails.
Why It Matters: Prevents life-threatening outages during disasters (e.g., Texas 2021 freeze).
Decision Tip: Homeowners in disaster-prone areas should invest in solar+battery backups.
