Nudge Theory is a concept from behavioral economics and public policy that focuses on subtle, non-coercive interventions (called "nudges") to influence decisions without restricting freedom of choice. 
It emphasizes that people are not always rational and are influenced by cognitive biases , defaults , and choice architecture.

<example>
Public Policy: Organ Donation Defaults
Field : Healthcare/Policy
Application : Many countries use opt-out organ donation systems (e.g., Spain, Germany) instead of opt-in systems (e.g., the U.S.).
Nudge : Automatically assume consent for organ donation unless the individual explicitly opts out.
Effect : Increases participation rates by reducing decision fatigue and leveraging social norms (people are more likely to comply with default options).
Outcome : Higher organ donation rates, saving more lives.

<example>
Healthcare: Flu Vaccination Campaigns
Field : Public Health
Application : Hospitals and clinics use visual nudges (e.g., posters, signage) to encourage flu vaccinations.
Nudge : Framing the vaccine as a "simple, safe, and effective" choice, often paired with social proof (e.g., "90% of staff get vaccinated").
Effect : Increases vaccination rates by addressing perceived risk and trust in the process .
Outcome : Reduced disease spread and hospitalizations during flu seasons.
