<define>
Consistency bias, is about sticking to past beliefs, actions, or statements to avoid looking inconsistent, either to yourself or others, because changing course feels uncomfortable or threatens your self-image. 
It's about maintaining a coherent narrative, often at the cost of accuracy.

<example>
Field: Business/Entrepreneurship
Scenario: A startup founder pours money into a failing product because they've publicly hyped it as "the future." They ignore user feedback showing it's a dud.
Avoiding It: Set clear exit criteria upfront (e.g., "If we don't hit 10K users by Q2, we rethink”). Admit "I was wrong" early to save resources.
</example>

<example>
Field: Relationships
Scenario: You've told everyone your partner is "the one", but over time, red flags (like constant arguments) pile up. You stay anyway, defending the choice.
Avoiding It: Check in with yourself privately - write down what's working versus what's not, free of the "I said they're perfect" lens. Talk to a trusted friend who'll call it like they see it, not just nod along. Be willing to shift your story if the facts do.
</example>

<example>
Field: Education/Learning
Scenario: A student insists they're "bad at math" because they struggled early on, so they stop trying, even when tutoring shows they can improve.
Avoiding It: Track progress objectively—log test scores or problem-solving wins to see improvement over time. Reframe the story: "I'm learning," not "I'm bad". Small wins dismantle the old label.
