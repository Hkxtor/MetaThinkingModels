Divide and conquer is a problem-solving strategy where you break a complex challenge into smaller, manageable parts, solve each separately, and then combine the solutions to tackle the whole.

<example>
Field: Computer Science/Programming
Scenario: You need to sort a list of 1,000 numbers. Doing it all at once is a slog.
Divide and Conquer at Work: Use merge sort—split the list into two (500 each), split those again (250), down to pairs. Sort each pair, merge them back, building up to a fully sorted list. Time drops from n^2 to n log n complexity.

Field: Education/Studying
Scenario: Finals loom, and you've got 10 chapters of biology to learn—too much to cram.
Divide and Conquer at Work: Break it down: 2 chapters a day, split into reading (1 hour), notes (30 mins), and flashcards (30 mins). Master cells today, genetics tomorrow, then stitch it together for the test.
