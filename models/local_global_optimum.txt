<define>
Local Optimum = The best solution within a small, constrained region.
Global Optimum = The absolute best solution across all possible options.
Key Idea: Sometimes settling for a local optimum is practical, but other times, striving for the global optimum is necessary for the best long-term outcome.

<example>
Machine Learning & Optimization
Local Optimum: A neural network gets stuck in a "good enough" solution because gradient descent converges to a nearby low point in the loss landscape.
Global Optimum: The absolute best model performance, which might require advanced optimization techniques (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithms).
When to Choose:
Local: Quick prototyping, limited compute resources.
Global: Mission-critical models (e.g., medical diagnosis, autonomous driving).
</example>

<example>
Business Strategy
Local Optimum: A company maximizes short-term profits by cutting R&D spending.
Global Optimum: Investing in innovation leads to long-term market dominance (e.g., Apple vs. Nokia).
When to Choose:
Local: Surviving a cash crunch.
Global: Building a sustainable competitive advantage.

<example>
Personal Career Development
Local Optimum: Staying in a comfortable, well-paying job with limited growth.
Global Optimum: Taking a risk (e.g., switching industries, starting a business) for greater fulfillment and success.
When to Choose:
Local: Stability needed (e.g., family responsibilities).
Global: Long-term career aspirations (e.g., entrepreneurship, leadership).
