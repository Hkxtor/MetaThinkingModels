MapReduce is a parallel programming model for processing large datasets across distributed systems. It consists of two main phases:
Map: Breaks input data into smaller chunks. Processes each chunk independently (in parallel), emitting key-value pairs.
Reduce: Aggregates intermediate results from the Map phase by key. Produces a final output (e.g., sum, average, or other computations).

<example>
Scientific Research (Climate Modeling)
How MapReduce applies:
Climate simulations generate massive datasets (e.g., temperature, CO₂ levels across regions).
Map: Divide data by geographic region or time period.
Reduce: Combine results to identify global trends (e.g., average temperature rise).
Why MapReduce?
Enables parallel processing of petabytes of data across supercomputers.

Business Analytics (Customer Segmentation)
How MapReduce applies:
Retailers process millions of transactions to group customers by behavior.
Map: Extract purchase histories (e.g., "Customer X bought Y, Z").
Reduce: Cluster similar buyers for targeted marketing.
Why MapReduce?
Handles large-scale data efficiently (e.g., Amazon’s recommendation systems).
