Porter's Five Forces assess the profitability and competitive intensity of an industry by analyzing five key forces that shape its structure.
1. Competitive Rivalry: Intensity of competition among existing firms.
2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: Ability of suppliers to raise prices or reduce quality.
3. Bargaining Power of Buyers: Ability of customers to demand lower prices or better service.
4. Threat of Substitute Products/Services: Risk of customers switching to alternatives.
5. Threat of New Entrants: Ease with which new competitors can enter the market.
</define>

<example>
Smartphone Industry (Apple, Samsung)
Rivalry: ★★★★★ (Intense – Apple vs. Samsung vs. Xiaomi)
Supplier Power: ★★★☆☆ (Apple negotiates hard, but depends on TSMC for chips)
Buyer Power: ★★★★☆ (Consumers have many choices; carriers influence pricing)
Substitutes: ★★☆☆☆ (Few direct substitutes for smartphones)
New Entrants: ★☆☆☆☆ (High barriers: R&D costs, patents, brand loyalty)
Verdict: Moderate profitability due to fierce rivalry and buyer power, but strong brands mitigate threats.
</example>

<example>
Coffee Shop Industry (Starbucks, Local Cafés)
Rivalry: ★★★★☆ (Starbucks vs. Dunkin’ vs. indie shops)
Supplier Power: ★★☆☆☆ (Many coffee bean suppliers, but Fair Trade can raise costs)
Buyer Power: ★★☆☆☆ (Low switching costs, but brand loyalty helps Starbucks)
Substitutes: ★★★★★ (Home brew, energy drinks, tea)
New Entrants: ★★★☆☆ (Low barriers for indie cafés; high for scaling like Starbucks)
Verdict: Mixed profitability – branding and location are critical to overcome substitutes.
