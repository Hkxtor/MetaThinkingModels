Exponential backoff is a strategy used primarily in computer networking and distributed systems to manage retries after a failure, like when a server doesn't respond. 
The idea is simple: if an attempt fails, wait a little before trying again, and if it fails again, wait longer—doubling (or exponentially increasing) the delay each time, often with some randomness (jitter) to avoid synchronized retries. 
It balances persistence with patience, preventing overload while still aiming for success.

<example>
Job Applications (Career): 
You apply for a job and get no response. Rather than spamming the employer daily, wait a week, then follow up. No reply? Wait two weeks, then four, maybe tweaking your email or contacting a different person. 
Cap it at a month and move on if needed. This keeps you persistent without seeming desperate, mirroring how backoff prevents server overload—your "request" gets a better shot when the timing's right.

Sales (Business): 
Pitching to a client who says "not now"? Call back in a week. No sale? Wait two weeks, then a month, each time refining your pitch or offering a small incentive. 
This avoids annoying them (overloading their "server") while keeping you in their orbit, increasing the odds they’ll bite when their needs shift—exponential delays respect their space.
