<define>
Backtracking, or depth first search (DFS), is a systematic recursive algorithmic technique for solving problems by exploring possible solutions incrementally and abandoning ("backtracking") partial candidates as soon as they are determined to be invalid.

<example>
Puzzle Solving (Sudoku, Crosswords, N-Queens)
How it works:
Try filling a cell with a valid number (1-9). If a conflict arises, backtrack and try the next possible number. Repeat until the grid is solved or all options are exhausted.
Why backtracking?
Exhaustive trial-and-error is inefficient; backtracking prunes invalid paths early.

<example>
DNA Sequence Alignment (Bioinformatics)
How it works:
Aligning gene sequences involves testing possible matches with gaps/mutations. If a partial alignment leads to biologically implausible results, backtrack and try a different gap penalty or substitution.
Why backtracking?
Enumerating all alignments is computationally infeasible; backtracking optimizes the search.
