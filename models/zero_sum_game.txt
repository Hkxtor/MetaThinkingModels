Zero-Sum Game: A situation where one party's gain is exactly balanced by another's loss. The total benefit or loss is always zero.
Example: Poker (your winnings come directly from others' losses).
Non-Zero-Sum Game: A scenario where cooperation or competition can lead to mutual gain or loss. The total outcome isn't fixedâ€”everyone can win or lose together.
Example: Trade (both parties benefit from exchanging goods/services).

<example>
Workplace Salaries
Misconception: "If my coworker gets a raise, there's less money left for me."
Reality (Non-Zero-Sum): A thriving company can reward multiple employees without reducing others' pay. 
High morale and productivity may even expand the budget.
How to Avoid: Advocate for team performance bonuses or profit-sharing models.

<example>
International Trade
Misconception: "If China exports more to the U.S., America 'loses' jobs and money."
Reality (Non-Zero-Sum): Trade lets countries specialize, lowering costs and increasing overall wealth (e.g., cheaper goods for U.S. consumers, jobs in Chinese factories).
How to Avoid: Focus on comparative advantage and long-term economic growth, not protectionism.
