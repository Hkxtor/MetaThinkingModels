Reductio ad Absurdum: A rhetorical and logical technique where an argument is disproven by showing it leads to an absurd, contradictory, or impossible conclusion when taken to its extreme.
Key Steps:
Assume the opponent's premise is true.
Demonstrate that this assumption results in an illogical or ridiculous outcome.
Conclude the original premise must be false.

<example>
Economics (Laissez-Faire Extremism)
Scenario: A policymaker argues "Zero regulation maximizes prosperity."
Reductio: If no regulations exist, companies could sell poisoned food (cutting costs). Consumers die → market collapses → prosperity vanishes.
Conclusion: Some regulation is necessary (e.g., FDA food safety rules).
</example>

<example>
Technology (AI Ethics)
Scenario: A tech CEO claims "User data should always be monetized."
Reductio:If all data is monetized, hospitals could sell mental health records to advertisers.
Patients avoid treatment → public health crisis → societal harm.
Conclusion: Ethical constraints on data use are essential.
