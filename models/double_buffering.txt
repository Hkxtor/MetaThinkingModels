<define>
Double buffering—the technique of using two buffers to enable smooth transitions while one is being updated—has real-world analogs beyond software (e.g., graphics rendering).
</define>

<example>
Problem: Screen flickering or tearing occurs when a display renders frames while they're being updated (e.g., in games or animations).
Double Buffering Solution:
Two framebuffers (memory regions) are used:
Front buffer: Currently displayed on screen.
Back buffer: Next frame is drawn here in the background.
When the back buffer is ready, they swap roles instantly (vs. drawing directly to the screen).
Why It Works:
Eliminates visual artifacts by decoupling rendering from display.

<example>
Theater Stage Design (Live Performances)
Problem: Scene changes between acts must be seamless to avoid interrupting the audience's immersion.
Double Buffering Solution:
Two rotating stages or sliding backdrops are used.
While one scene is active, the next is pre-assembled on a hidden buffer (e.g., a turntable or secondary stage).
At the transition, the buffers "swap" instantly (e.g., rotating the turntable).
Example: Broadway musicals like Les Misérables use revolving stages to switch between barricade scenes smoothly.
