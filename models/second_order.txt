<define>
Second-order thinking is the practice of considering not just the immediate consequences of an action (first-order effects), but also the subsequent, longer-term, or indirect consequences (second-order effects). It's about asking: "And then what?"

<example>
Action: A government prints more money to boost the economy.
First-Order Effect: More cash circulates; short-term spending rises.
Second-Order Effect: Inflation spikes, eroding savings and trust in currency.
</example>

<example>
Action: Introduce rabbits to Australia for hunting.
First-Order Effect: Hunters enjoy new game.
Second-Order Effect: Rabbits overbreed, destroying crops and ecosystems.
</example>

<example>
Action: Optimize algorithms for "engagement."
