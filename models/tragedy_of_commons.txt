<define>
The tragedy of the Commons describes a situation where individuals, acting in their own self-interest, deplete a shared resource, even when it's against the group's long-term benefit. Key Idea: "What's rational for one is disastrous for all."

<example>
Environment (Overfishing)
Tragedy: Fishermen maximize catches until fish populations collapse.
Solution: 1. Quotas (e.g., Iceland’s sustainable fishing licenses). 2. Privatization (assign ownership rights, like tradable fishing zones).
</example>

<example>
Public Health (Antibiotic Resistance)
Tragedy: Overuse of antibiotics by individuals breeds superbugs.
Solution:1. Regulate prescriptions (e.g., UK’s antibiotic stewardship programs). 2. Public education on responsible use.
</example>

<example>
Urban Traffic (Road Congestion)
Tragedy: Everyone drives because it's fastest for them, creating gridlock.
Solution: 1. Congestion pricing (e.g., London's tolls). 2. Invest in public transit to reduce individual incentives to drive.
