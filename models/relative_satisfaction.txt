<define>
Relative satisfaction refers to the idea that our sense of contentment or happiness isn't absolute, it's shaped by comparison to others, past experiences, or expectations rather than an objective standard.

<example>
Field: Personal Finance
Scenario: You earn $80,000 a year and feel good until you learn your friend makes $120,000. Suddenly, your salary feels inadequate.
Avoiding Mistakes: Focus on your own goals (e.g., saving for a house) rather than benchmarking against others. Track your net worth over time, compare to your past self, not your friend's paycheck. 
</example>

<example>
Field: Health and Fitness
Scenario: You start running and lose 10 pounds, but feel discouraged seeing gym buffs with chiseled physiques.
Avoiding Mistakes: Set personal baselines, track your own runs or lifts rather than eyeing the ripped guy. Celebrate relative gains (10 pounds is huge compared to zero!) to stay motivated without burnout.
