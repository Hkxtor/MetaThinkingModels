<define>
The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users (n²). 
In short: More users = Exponentially more valuable connections.
</define>

<example>
Social Media (Facebook, X/Twitter)
How it works: A platform with 10 users has ~45 possible connections (10²/2); 100 users have ~4,950 connections.
Impact: The more users join, the more valuable the network becomes (for advertisers, influencers, and users themselves).
</example>

<example>
Telecommunications (Telephone, Internet)
How it works: A single phone is useless; two phones allow one connection; 1 billion phones enable trillions of potential calls.
Historical example: AT&T's early monopoly thrived by ensuring universal connectivity.
Modern twist: 5G and IoT devices amplify network effects further.
