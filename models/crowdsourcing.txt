Crowdsourcing is a method of problem-solving or task completion that involves outsourcing work to a large, often undefined group of people—typically via an open call—rather than relying on a small, designated team. 
It leverages the collective intelligence, skills, or resources of a crowd, often facilitated by digital platforms.

<example>
Technology and Software Development
Problem: Improving software or fixing bugs quickly.
Example: GitHub and Open-Source Software – Projects like Linux or Mozilla Firefox rely on crowdsourcing where developers worldwide contribute code, report bugs, or suggest features. Anyone can submit improvements via GitHub, refining the software collaboratively.
How It Works: Thousands of programmers voluntarily debug or enhance the codebase, accelerating development without a centralized team.
Outcome: Robust, widely-used software built faster and cheaper than proprietary alternatives.

Business and Innovation
Problem: Generating new product ideas or solving design challenges.
Example: LEGO Ideas – LEGO invites fans to submit and vote on new set designs. If a concept gets 10,000 votes, LEGO considers producing it, crediting the creator (e.g., the Apollo 11 set).
How It Works: Customers crowdsource creativity, submitting and refining ideas via an online platform.
Outcome: LEGO taps into consumer ingenuity, producing popular sets while engaging its community.
