Path dependence is a concept where the outcome of a process or system depends heavily on its historical trajectory, not just its current conditions. 
Early decisions, events, or conditions set a course that shapes future possibilities, often locking in certain patterns even if better alternatives exist later.

<example>
Technology
Example: The QWERTY keyboard layout.
Explanation: Designed in the 1870s for typewriters to prevent jamming, QWERTY became standard despite more efficient layouts (e.g., Dvorak) emerging later. 
Early adoption by typists and manufacturers created a network effectâ€”training, habits, and production locked it in.
How It Applies: Path dependence shows why a suboptimal design dominates today's keyboards, as switching costs outweigh potential gains.

Policy and Institutions
Example: The U.S. healthcare system.
Explanation: Unlike countries with universal healthcare, the U.S. path began with employer-based insurance during WWII wage controls. This private system gained momentum, reinforced by tax incentives and lobbying, making a shift to single-payer harder despite rising costs.
How It Applies: Early policy choices created a self-reinforcing structure, showing how path dependence can entrench systems even when alternatives might be more efficient.
