<define>
Loss aversion is a behavioral economics principle that describes how people tend to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. 
In other words, the emotional pain of losing something is felt more intensely than the pleasure of gaining the same amount.

<example>
Personal Finance and Investing
Scenario: An investor holds a stock that's dropped 20% in value.
How It Plays Out: Rather than selling at a loss, they hold onto it, hoping to "break even," even if better opportunities exist elsewhere. The pain of locking in a $1,000 loss outweighs the potential joy of a $1,000 gain from reinvesting.
Why: Loss aversion makes them prioritize avoiding the realized loss over maximizing future gains, often leading to suboptimal financial decisions.
</example>

<example>
Healthcare
Scenario: A patient decides whether to undergo a risky surgery.
How It Plays Out: If told the surgery has a "90% success rate" (gain frame), they might hesitate. But if told "Without surgery, you have a 10% chance of dying" (loss frame), they're more likely to proceed. The fear of losing their life outweighs the appeal of a probable recovery.
Why: Loss aversion amplifies the perceived cost of inaction, pushing people toward choices that minimize potential losses.
</example>

<example>
Sports and Competition
Scenario: A soccer team is tied in the final minutes of a match.
How It Plays Out: The team shifts to a defensive strategy to avoid conceding a goal (a loss) rather than aggressively pursuing a winning goal (a gain). Coaches and players prioritize not losing over the chance to win.
Why: The sting of defeat feels worse than the thrill of victory, so avoiding a loss becomes the dominant motive.
