<define>
A self-fulfilling prophecy occurs when a belief or expectation, whether true or false, influences behavior in a way that causes the belief to come true. Essentially, people act based on their assumptions, creating outcomes that align with those assumptions.

<example>
Economics & Financial Markets
Example: A bank is rumored to be insolvent (even if it's financially sound).
How It Unfolds:
People panic and withdraw their money.
The bank loses liquidity and actually collapses.
Result: The false belief caused the very crisis it predicted.
</example>

<example>
Education & Student Performance
Example: A teacher believes a student is "gifted" (or "struggling").
How It Unfolds:
The teacher gives the "gifted" student more attention and challenges, boosting their performance.
The "struggling" student receives less encouragement, leading to poorer results.
Result: The initial label shapes the outcome.
</example>

<example>
Workplace & Employee Performance
Example: A manager assumes a new hire is a "high performer."
How It Unfolds:
The manager assigns them important projects, offers mentorship, and gives positive feedback.
The employee, feeling trusted, works harder and succeeds.
Result: The manager's belief created the high performer.
