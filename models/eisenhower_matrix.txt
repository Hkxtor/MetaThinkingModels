A productivity tool (also called the Urgent-Important Matrix) that helps prioritize tasks by categorizing them into four quadrants based on urgency and importance. It's named after President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who famously said:
"What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important."
The 4 Quadrants:
Important and urgent Q1: Do Now (Crises, deadlines)	
Important and not urgent Q2: Schedule (Long-term goals)
Not Important and urgent Q3: Delegate (Interruptions)	
Not important and not urgent Q4: Eliminate (Time-wasters)
</define>

<example>
Business Leadership (CEO Decision-Making)
Scenario: A CEO manages their weekly tasks.
Q1 (Do Now):
Handling a sudden PR crisis (urgent & important).
Signing off on quarterly financial reports due today.

Q2 (Schedule):
Strategic planning for next year’s product launch (important but not urgent).
Leadership team development workshops.

Q3 (Delegate):
Responding to non-critical emails (urgent but not important → assign to an assistant).
Routine operational meetings (let a VP lead).

Q4 (Eliminate):
Browsing industry news without a clear purpose.
Attending unnecessary networking events.
Outcome: The CEO focuses on high-impact work (Q1 & Q2) while minimizing distractions.

<example>
Personal Productivity (Freelancer Workflow)
Scenario: A freelance graphic designer manages their workload.
Q1 (Do Now):
Client revision due in 2 hours.
Fixing a website bug affecting payments.

Q2 (Schedule):
Learning a new design software (skill upgrade).
Networking with potential long-term clients.

Q3 (Delegate):
Invoice reminders (use an automated tool).
Social media posts (hire a virtual assistant).

Q4 (Eliminate):
Scrolling Instagram for "inspiration."
Over-optimizing low-priority designs.
Outcome: The freelancer avoids burnout by focusing on high-value tasks (Q1/Q2) and automating/deleting the rest.
