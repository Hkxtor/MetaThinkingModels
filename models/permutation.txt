Permutation refers to the arrangement of items in a specific order. Permutations care about sequence. 
For combinations, order doesn't matter.
It is useful for estimating the complexity of a problem, or the probability of an event.

Problem: How strong is a password?
Permutation Insight: An 8-character password using 94 possible symbols (letters, numbers, special chars) has 94^8â‰ˆ6.1*10^15 permutations.
Decision Impact: Longer passwords with diverse characters exponentially increase security.

Problem: How many ways can sports teams be ranked?
Permutation Insight: 6 teams can finish in 6!=720 unique orders.
Decision Impact: Helps design fair playoff brackets or betting odds.

Problem: Testing all feature combinations in a smartphone.
Permutation Insight: 5 features with 3 options each: 3^5=243 permutations.
Decision Impact: Use fractional factorial designs to test only critical combinations.
