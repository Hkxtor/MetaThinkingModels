A Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is a scientific experiment that randomly assigns participants into treatment and control groups to measure the effect of an intervention while minimizing bias. It is the gold standard for establishing cause-and-effect relationships in research.
Key features: randomization, control group, blinding (single/double-blind).

Medicine & Healthcare
