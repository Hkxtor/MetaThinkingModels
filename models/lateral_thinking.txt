Lateral thinking, or thinking out of the box, is a creative problem-solving approach that involves looking at a situation from unconventional angles, challenging assumptions, and stepping outside traditional step-by-step logic.
It contrasts with "vertical thinking," which follows a linear, sequential path. Lateral thinking seeks to break patterns, generate fresh ideas, and find solutions by reframing problems or combining seemingly unrelated concepts.

Business and Marketing
Problem: How to sell more toothpaste?
Conventional Approach: Improve flavor or advertise whitening benefits.
Lateral Thinking: A toothpaste company reimagines the product’s delivery—widening the tube's opening. Customers use more per squeeze, increasing consumption without changing habits.
How It Works: Instead of focusing on the product or consumer behavior, the solution shifts to packaging, bypassing traditional marketing assumptions.

Engineering
Problem: How to keep a skyscraper stable in high winds?
Conventional Approach: Reinforce the structure with more steel or concrete.
Lateral Thinking: The Taipei 101 building's designers install a massive tuned mass damper—a giant pendulum that sways opposite to wind forces. Inspired by how a child's swing counters motion, they adapt a simple physics trick to a complex problem.
How It Works: Rather than bulking up the building, they rethink stability as a dynamic balance, sidestepping traditional brute-force methods.
