Cost benefit analysis: A systematic approach to comparing the total expected costs and total expected benefits of a decision, project, or policy, often quantified in monetary terms. The goal is to determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs (and by how much).

<example>
Business (Automation Investment)
Scenario: A factory debates replacing workers with robots.
Costs:
Robots + installation ($2M upfront).
Training staff ($200K).
Higher energy/maintenance ($50K/year).
Benefits:
Labor cost savings ($1M/year in wages/benefits).
Fewer defects (saves $300K/year in waste).
Faster production (extra $500K/year in revenue).
CBA Result:
Payback period = ~2 years; NPV positive - Worth investing.
</example>

<example>
Healthcare (Vaccination Program)
Scenario: A government evaluates a free measles vaccination campaign.
Costs:
Vaccine production & distribution ($100M).
Public education ($5M).
Side-effect treatments ($2M).
Benefits:
Reduced hospitalizations (saves $200M in treatment costs).
Increased workforce productivity ($150M from fewer sick days).
Lives saved (estimated value: $300M using statistical life valuation).
CBA Result:
Benefit-Cost Ratio = (200M+150M+300M)/(100M+5M+2M)â‰ˆ6:1 - Highly favorable
