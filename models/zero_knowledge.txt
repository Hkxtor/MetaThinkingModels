A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method where one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement itself.
Key Properties:
Completeness: If the statement is true, the verifier will be convinced.
Soundness: If the statement is false, no dishonest prover can trick the verifier.
Zero-Knowledge: The verifier learns nothing except that the statement is true.

<example>
Privacy-Preserving Authentication (Logins Without Passwords)
Problem: Traditional logins require sharing passwords or biometrics, risking leaks.
ZKP Solution:
A user proves they know a password (e.g., via cryptographic hash) without sending the password itself.
</example>

<example>
Anonymous Voting (Election Integrity)
Problem: How to verify a vote was counted without revealing voter identity?
ZKP Solution:
A voter proves their ballot is valid (e.g., signed by a registered key) but hides their selection.
Used in: Decentralized voting protocols (e.g., MACI by Ethereum's Privacy & Scaling Explorations).

Confidential Financial Transactions (Banking & Crypto)
Problem: Banks need to comply with regulations (e.g., proving solvency) without exposing customer balances.
ZKP Solution:
A bank proves it has enough reserves to cover liabilities without revealing individual accounts.
Used in: Zcash (shielded transactions), Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).
