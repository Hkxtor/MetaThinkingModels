Supply and demand is a foundational economic concept that explains how prices are determined by the balance between how much of something is available (supply) and how much people want it (demand). 
When demand exceeds supply, prices rise; When supply outstrips demand, prices drop.

<example>
Field: Personal Finance/Shopping
Scenario: You want a new phone. During a holiday sale, supply's high (stores stock up), demand spikes but spreads out—prices dip. Post-sale, supply shrinks, demand holds—prices climb.
Using It: Time purchases—buy when supply peaks (sales, off-season) or demand dips (midweek flights). Decide: "Is this scarce now, or can I wait for a glut?" It saves cash—like $200 on that phone.

Field: Career/Job Market
Scenario: Software engineers are in demand (tech boom), but supply's tight (few skilled coders)—salaries soar. Meanwhile, retail jobs have high supply (many workers), low demand (automation)—wages stagnate.
Using It: Pick skills where demand outpaces supply—learn AI, not typewriter repair. Decide: "Where's the shortage I can fill?" It guides you to a $100K gig over a $30K rut.
