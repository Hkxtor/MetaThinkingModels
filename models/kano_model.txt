The Kano Model is developed for understanding Customer Delight. It classify customer preferences into categories to prioritize product features and enhance satisfaction.
The 3 Core Categories
1. Basic Needs (Must-Be Features)
What: Expected requirements; their absence causes dissatisfaction, but presence doesn’t increase satisfaction.
Business Implication: Fail here, and you lose customers fast.
2. Performance Needs (One-Dimensional Features)
What: Features where satisfaction scales linearly with performance.
Business Implication: Competitive differentiation happens here.
3. Delighters (Excitement Features)
What: Unexpected perks that wow customers. Over time, these become expectations.
Business Implication: Drives word-of-mouth and loyalty.
