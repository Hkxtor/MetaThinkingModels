Sunk costs refer to resources—time, money, effort—that have already been invested in a project or decision and cannot be recovered, regardless of future outcomes. 
In economic and decision-making theory, sunk costs should ideally be ignored when evaluating whether to continue an endeavor, as they don't change based on what happens next.

<example>
Business
Scenario: A failing product launch.
Explanation: A company spends $5 million developing a gadget that's poorly received. Despite weak sales, they pour another $2 million into marketing to recoup the initial investment, rather than pivoting to a new product.
How It Applies: The $5 million is a sunk cost—unrecoverable regardless of future action. Continuing often stems from the fallacy, while abandoning it for a fresh start aligns with rational cost-benefit analysis.

Education
Scenario: Sticking with an unsuitable degree.
Explanation: A student spends three years and $60,000 on a major they dislike. Rather than switching to a field they love (adding a year), they finish the original degree to avoid "wasting" their investment.
How It Applies: The time and money are sunk—staying the course locks them into an unhappy career. Recognizing sunk costs could free them to pursue a better fit, focusing on future value.
