Deliberate practice is a structured, focused method of skill improvement involving: Specific Goals (not just repetition), Immediate Feedback (to correct errors), Stepping Outside Comfort Zones (targeted challenges).
Popularized by Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, the 10,000-hour rule suggests mastery requires roughly 10,000 hours of such practice—though quality matters more than raw time.
