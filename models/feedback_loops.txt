Feedback loops are systems where outputs circle back as inputs, amplifying or stabilizing a process.
- Positive Feedback Loops: Self-reinforcing. Output amplifies the effect (e.g., viral growth, climate tipping points).
- Negative Feedback Loops: Self-correcting. Output dampens the effect (e.g., thermostats, body temperature regulation).

<example>
Social Media (Algorithmic Virality)
Positive Feedback: A post gets likes - algorithm shows it to more people - more likes.
Example: TikTok trends explode when engagement triggers exponential visibility.
Decision Impact: Content creators optimize for early engagement to "ride the loop."
</example>

<example>
Climate Change (Tipping Points)
Positive Feedback: Arctic ice melts - less sunlight reflected - more warming - more melting.
Decision Impact: Reduce emissions before loops become irreversible.
</example>

<example>
Business (Customer Reviews)
Positive Feedback: Good reviews - more sales - more reviews - higher rankings.
Negative Feedback: Bad reviews - fewer sales - company improves product.
Decision Impact: Prioritize customer service to sustain virtuous cycles.
