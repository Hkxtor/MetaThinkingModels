<define>
Moore's Law observes that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, leading to exponential growth in computing power while costs decrease.

<example>
Evolution of Computer Processors
Example: Intel's processors from the 1970s (e.g., 4004 with 2,300 transistors) vs. todayâ€™s chips (e.g., Apple M2 with 20 billion transistors).
Impact: Faster, more efficient computers (from room-sized mainframes to pocket-sized smartphones).

Transistor Count & Performance Scaling
Example:
Nvidia GTX 480 (2010): 3 billion transistors, 1.4 TFLOPS
RTX 4090 (2022): 76 billion transistors, ~90 TFLOPS
Why it fits Moore's Law:
Transistor count increased ~25x in 12 years (~2x every 2 years).
Performance (FLOPS) grew even faster due to architectural improvements (e.g., CUDA cores, tensor cores).
