<define>
Incentives are rewards or punishments that motivate behavior. They align (or misalign) individual actions with desired outcomes by tapping into human psychologyâ€”greed, fear, social approval, or curiosity.

<example>
Workplace Productivity (Sales Commissions)
How It Works: Pay salespeople 10% commission on deals - they hustle harder.
Flip Side: If commissions reward any sale (not profitable ones), they'll push low-margin deals.
Decision Tip: Design incentives that align with long-term goals (e.g., profit-based bonuses).

<example>
Education (Grades vs. Learning)
How It Works: Students study to earn A's, not to master material - cram-and-forget cycles.
Flip Side: Pass/fail grading reduces stress but may lower effort.
Decision Tip: Reward curiosity (e.g., project-based learning over rote tests).
</example>

Corporate Ethics (Whistleblower Bounties)
How It Works: Pay employees 20% of fines for reporting fraud - more fraud exposed.
Flip Side: May encourage false reports for profit.
Decision Tip: Audit claims rigorously to prevent gaming.
