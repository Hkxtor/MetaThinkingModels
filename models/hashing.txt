Hashing is a computer science technique that takes any input (like text, files, or data) and converts it into a fixed-size string of characters (usually numbers and letters) called a hash value or digest. This process is done using a hash function, which is designed to be:
Deterministic → Same input always gives the same hash
Fast to compute → Quick to generate hashes
Hard to reverse → Can't easily get the original input from the hash
Collision-resistant → Different inputs should (ideally) not produce the same hash.
</define>

<example>
Data Retrieval & Databases
Hash Tables (Fast Lookup): Databases use hashing to store and retrieve data in constant time (O(1)).
Deduplication: Cloud storage (e.g., Dropbox) checks file hashes to avoid storing duplicates.

<example>
Plagiarism Detection
Document Fingerprinting: Tools like Turnitin hash text chunks to compare against a database of sources.

Networking & Load Balancing
Consistent Hashing (Distributed Systems): Used by CDNs (like Cloudflare) to evenly distribute web traffic across servers.
