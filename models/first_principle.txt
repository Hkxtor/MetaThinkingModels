First-principles thinking is a problem-solving approach where you strip away all assumptions and conventions, then rebuild your understanding from the ground up using fundamental truths. 
Instead of relying on analogies or "how things are usually done," you ask: "What are the irreducible facts?"
Elon Musk: "Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there."

<example>
SpaceX: Cheap Rockets
Assumption: "Rockets cost $65M (market price)."
First Principles:
What's a rocket made of? Aluminum, titanium, copper, fuel.
Raw materials cost ~2% of the rocket's price.
Solution: Build reusable rockets in-house (cutting 90% of costs).

Modernaâ€™s mRNA Vaccines
Assumption: "Vaccines take 10 years to develop."
First Principles:
What's a vaccine? Instructions to teach cells to fight viruses.
Can we deliver mRNA (instructions) directly?
Solution: Skip live viruses, use synthetic mRNA (COVID-19 vaccine in <1 year).
