<define>
A counterintuitive statistical principle stating that in many naturally occurring datasets, the leading digits (1â€“9) follow a predictable logarithmic distribution, where: 1 appears ~30% of the time, 2 appears ~17.6%, 9 appears ~4.6%.
Unlike uniform randomness, numbers in real-world data (e.g., populations, financial records) tend to cluster around lower digits due to multiplicative processes.

<example>
Fraud Detection (Forensic Accounting)
Example: Enron's manipulated financial statements had digit distributions that violated Benford's Law.
How? Genuine expense reports or tax filings naturally follow Benford's pattern. Fraudsters forging numbers (e.g., round figures like $500) deviate from it.
Use: Auditors flag anomalies (e.g., IRS uses it to detect tax evasion).

<example>
Election Forensics (Vote Counting)
Example: Analyzing vote counts for irregularities.
How? Legitimate election results (e.g., precinct-level votes) typically fit Benford's distribution. Sudden spikes at round numbers (e.g., 100, 500) suggest manipulation.
Use: Used to investigate anomalies in Iran's 2009 election.
