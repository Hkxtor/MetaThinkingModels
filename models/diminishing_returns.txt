<define>
The law of diminishing marginal returns states that adding more of one input (e.g., time, money, effort) while holding other inputs constant will eventually yield smaller incremental benefits.

<example>
Field: Agriculture (Fertilizer Use)
Example: Adding 1kg of fertilizer to a field boosts crop yield by 20%. Adding another 1kg might only boost it by 5%, and eventually harms plants (negative returns).
Decision Impact: Farmers optimize fertilizer use at the "sweet spot" before marginal gains vanish.
</example>

<example>
Field: Business (Advertising Spend)
Example: A startup's first 10K ad spending brings 100 new customers, the next 10K spending might only bring 30, then 10, as the market saturates.
Decision Impact: Shift budgets to new channels (e.g., influencer marketing vs. Google Ads).
</example>

<example>
Field: Technology (Software Features)
Example: Adding 10 features to an app delights users. Adding 50 more creates bloat, slowing performance and confusing users.
Decision Impact: Prioritize simplicity (e.g., Apple's minimalist design).
