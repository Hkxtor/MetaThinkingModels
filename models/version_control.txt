Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to:
Track every modification ("who changed what, and when")
Revert to previous versions if needed
Collaborate without overwriting others' work
Key Concepts:
Repository (Repo): Central database storing all versions
Commit: A saved change with a description
Branch: Parallel version for experimental changes
Merge: Combining different versions together
</define>

<example>
Software Development (Original Use Case)
GitHub/GitLab: Developers collaborate on code
Example: Linux kernel development (thousands of contributors)
Feature Branches: Test new ideas without breaking working code
</example>

<example>
Government & Policy
Legislation Drafting: Track bill amendments
Example: European Union's EUR-Lex document system
Public Records: Maintain historical versions of laws.
</example>

Creative Writing
