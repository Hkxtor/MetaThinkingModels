A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It models decisions by splitting data into branches based on feature values, leading to leaf nodes (final predictions).

<example>
Healthcare (Disease Diagnosis)
Problem: Predict whether a patient has diabetes.
Features: Blood sugar level, BMI, age.
Tree Splits:
Root: *Glucose > 120 mg/dL?* → Yes/No branches.
Next: BMI > 30? → Further splits.
Output: "Diabetic" or "Non-diabetic" at leaves.
Use: Helps doctors prioritize high-risk patients.
</example>

<example>
Finance (Loan Approval)
Problem: Should a bank approve a loan?
Features: Credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio.
Tree Splits:
Root: Credit score > 700? → Yes/No.
Next: Income > $50k? → Final decision.
Output: "Approve" or "Reject."
Use: Automates risk assessment while ensuring transparency.
